# Overview

This technical documentation is for scientists who are working with the [Federal Science DataHub (FSDH)](https://federal-science-datahub.canada.ca/) to manage and analyze scientific data. It includes guides on how to use various features:

* Setting up and managing workspaces and users
* Using storage containers with FSDH, including bring-your-own storage options
* Working with Azure Databricks for data processing and analysis
* Hosting web applications on FSDH

If you are new to the FSDH, we invite you to start with our [Canada.ca pages](https://www.canada.ca/fr/services-partages/services/outils-pour-personnes-travaillant-gc/outils-scientifique/plateforme-federale-donnees-scientifiques.html) that give a general overview of the platform. For Government of Canada users, we also invite you to visit the [FSDH GCXchange site](https://gcxgce.sharepoint.com/teams/10002160/SitePages/fr/Home.aspx) for additional resources and information.
