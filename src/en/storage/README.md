Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.

Blob storage is ideal for:

* storing large datasets from experiments
* archiving research data
* sharing data with collaborators
* managing data from IoT devices in field experiments
